![shattereddimension](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d462980f-5290-4249-a518-e98806c0dcb6)

# Instructions
Go to releases and download the latest `SpidermanShatteredDimensions.zip`, extract the `d3d9.dll` and `d3d9.ini` files into your game folder next to the `Game.exe` file, and you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the `d3d9.ini` file.

This fix is only designed to work in the Steam version of the game, as any other version has stability issues.

# Resolution/Aspect Ratio
The default for resolution is set to `1920x1080` in the `d3d9.ini` file. Put the resolution that you wish to use in both the `ResolutionWidth` and `ResolutionHeight` field.

Resolution and aspect ratio edits are done together so you will only have to choose your resolution.

You can play the game in windowed mode by setting `WindowedMode` to `1`.

# FPS
The default FPS limit of the game is 60. You can set the game to play at the FPS you want in `d3d9.ini`.

Due to how the game is designed, problems will occur if the frame rate is much lower than the limit: **do not set the limit to a frame rate that isn't reached**.

# FOV
You can set `fov` to either `1` or `2` in the `d3d9.ini` file to increase the FOV in game.

The game will start with the original FOV by default. When in game, press the hotkey you chose in `[hotkey]keycodes.txt` and enter the virtual code in the ini to toggle between the original and the new FOV setting.

**General important note** – The game has bugs at higher FOVs, such as menus being misaligned, or enemies being able to see Spider-Man Noir when he is nowhere near them in the stealth sections. It is advised that the user uses the toggle feature during these moments to prevent these bugs.
