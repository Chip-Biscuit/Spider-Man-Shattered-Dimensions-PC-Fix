# Instructions
Go to releases and download the latest SpidermanShatteredDimensions.zip, extract the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini files into your game folder next to the Game.exe file and you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d9.ini file.

# Resolution/Aspect Ratio
The default for resolution is set to (1920 x 1080) in the d3d9.ini file. Put the resolution that you wish to use in both the Width and Height area.

Resolution and aspect ratio edits are done together so you will only have to choose your resolution.

# FPS
The default for FPS is (60) you can change it as you wish or fully uncap it with (0) with the FPSLimit option in the d3d9.ini file. This games max FPS is set to 360.

# FOV
The default for FOV is (0) which is the original games FOV. You can choose either 1 ,2 or 0 in the d3d9.ini file and each option will increase the FOV in game.

The game will start with the original FOV by default and when in game you can press the hotkey you chose in [hotkey]keycodes.txt and enter the virtual code in the ini to toggle between the original and new FOV setting.

**General important note** – When using FOV on higher settings then the game can have bugs such as menus becoming misaligned and in certain cases in the stealth Noir levels enemies will be able to see Spider-Man when he is nowhere near them. It is advised that the user uses the toggle feature during these moments to fix these bugs.

# Window Mode
If you wish to use windowed mode, then you can select your resolution using the resolution setting. This then works in window mode and fullscreen, (0) is window mode and (1) is fullscreen mode.
