# Instructions
Go to releases and download the latest SpidermanShatteredDimensions.zip, extract the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini files into your game folder next to the Game.exe file and you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d9.ini file.

This fix is only designed to work in the steam version of the game any other version has stability issues.
# Resolution/Aspect Ratio
The default for resolution is set to (1920 x 1080) in the d3d9.ini file. Put the resolution that you wish to use in both the Width and Height area.

Resolution and aspect ratio edits are done together so you will only have to choose your resolution.

# FPS
Default for FPS cap is 60 you can set the game to play at the FPS you wish in d3d9.ini for example 30, 60, 120 fps playing at a fps above the games original 60 is done so at the users own risk as it has been known to cause bugs within the game. "Set to a frame rate that is actually reached: problems occur if the game's frame rate is drastically lower than the limit."

# FOV
The default for FOV is (0) which is the original games FOV. You can choose either 1 ,2 or 0 in the d3d9.ini file and each option will increase the FOV in game.

The game will start with the original FOV by default and when in game you can press the hotkey you chose in [hotkey]keycodes.txt and enter the virtual code in the ini to toggle between the original and new FOV setting.

**General important note** – When using FOV on higher settings then the game can have bugs such as menus becoming misaligned and in certain cases in the stealth Noir levels enemies will be able to see Spider-Man when he is nowhere near them. It is advised that the user uses the toggle feature during these moments to fix these bugs.

# Window Mode
If you wish to use windowed mode, then you can select your resolution using the resolution setting. This then works in window mode and fullscreen, (0) is window mode and (1) is fullscreen mode.

# Issues/Problems
unfortunately this game has issues on AMD hardware, this fix has not been made with the intention of fixing issues on AMD as i do not have access to this hardware, this fix is only aimed at and tested on 
intel/nvidia hardware only. its possible in the future if i can get my hands on AMD it will be looked at so keep an eye for updates.
but be aware if you have AMD this fix probably wont work for you.
